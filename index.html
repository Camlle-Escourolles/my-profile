Very dynamic, I devote myself entirely to the projects I take part in. I have learned temporisation and observation from martial arts, discovered team work in soccer and perseverance in track.

          <h2>I love to travel - Discover new places</h2>
        <p>
          Very curious, I absolutely love traveling. Firstly for obvious reasons (sun, beach, fun), but in the end mainly to <strong>discover</strong> and answer my taste for <strong>adventure</strong>. I truly believe, we all have to evolve by going out of our confort zone and going to new places in the world helps me do that. I love to meet new people, discover new cultures and way of thinking.

    <div id="Curiosity" class="card-white">
        <h2> Curiosity</h2>
      If I had to give myself one <strong>adjective</strong>, it would be: <strong>curious</strong>. I will spend days and week learning on all kind of subjects. I am always seeking <strong>new information</strong> and new qualifications. I enjoy to learn. One of my biggest passion is animals and nature. I regurarly take part in associative programs, that fight animal cruaulty.
